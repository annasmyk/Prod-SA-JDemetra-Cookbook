    "text": "What is JDemetra+?\nJDemetra+ is an open source software for seasonal adjustment and time series analysis, developed by the National Bank of Belgium with the support of the Bundesbank, Insee and the partners of the COSA, (COfidentiality Seasonal Adjustment and time series), project co-founded by Eurostat. JDemetra+ has been officially recommended by Eurostat to the members of the European Statistical System since 2015. It is unique in its combination of very fast Java routines, a Graphical User Interface and an ecosystem of R packages (rjdverse). The graphical interface provides structured visual feedback suitable for refined analysis and training. R tools allow to combine the capabilities of JDemetra+ with the versatility of the R world, be it for statistical functions or data wrangling. A pdf version of this documentation is available here"

    "text": "Installing the software\nThe sections below detail how to install JDemetra+ (Graphical user interface and Cruncher) and how to configure R to run rjd3 packages.\n\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\nYou can find the latest releases\n\nin the v2.x family: here\n\nTo install v2.2.4:\n\nScroll down the page, download and unzip the file jdemetra-2.2.4-bin.zip.\nTo start the application, run the file nbdemetra64.exe located in the following subfolder …\\jdemetra-2.2.4-bin\\nbdemetra\\bin\n\nRemark: You can create shortcuts to the executable files if you want to launch them from another folder (Desktop, project folder…).\n\nin the v3.x family: here\n\nYou should install the latest release available denoted from now on v3.x.y\n\nScroll down the page, download and unzip the file jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip, if you use Windows, or the zip corresponding to your OS in the list.\nTo start the application, run the file nbdemetra64.exe located in the following subfolder …\\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\\nbdemetra\\bin\n\nVersion 3.x requires Java 17 or higher, jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip contains a portable version of Java, so you don’t have to deal with this issue on your computer.\nR packages related to version 3.x (rjd3…) also require Java 17 or higher, you can (and should) use the portable version provided with the graphical user interface to run them, this is explained here.\n\n\nAdditional Plug-ins\nTo benefit from extended features of the graphical user interface installing additional plug-ins is required. The list of available extensions and the installation procedure are detailed here. How to access the added features in the GUI is described here.\nIn the v2.x family some of the additional features are:\n\nBenchmarking and Temporal disaggregation Plug-in here\nNowcasting Plug-in here\n\nIn the v3.x family some of the additional features are:\n\nBenchmarking and Temporal disaggregation Plug-in here\nSeasonal adjustment of high frequency data Plug-ins here\nAdditional algorithms for seasonal adjustment Plug-ins here\n\n\n\nCruncher\nJDemetra+ has an executable module, called the Cruncher, allowing to automate tasks\nTo install it :\n\nin v2, go to the JWSACruncher page, download and unzip the compressed folder jwsacruncher-2.2.x-bin.zip, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.\nin v3, go to the jdplus-main page, download and unzip the compressed folder jwsacruncher-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.\n\n\n\nR packages\nJDemetra+ algorithms can be accessed in R, which is detailed here\nYou can directly head over to this GitHub page, then for each package indications for installation and basic use are provided in the readme files.\n\n\nConfiguration needed to run rjd3 packages\nTo use rjd3 packages in R, you need Java 17 or higher.\nYou can (and should) use the version of Java that comes with the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is contained in the file jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip available on this page, in the “Assets” section, which you might have to expand to be able to see all the files.\nOnce unzipped, the Java will be in located in C:\\Software\\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\\nbdemetra\\jdk-21.0.2+13-jre (path to be adapted to your computer/server): this location must be declared in R.\nAfter unzipping the file:\n\nrun this code at the beginning of your programs\n\n\nSys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = \".../jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre\")\n\nor\n\ndeclare it “permanently” is the Renviron file (where environment variables specific to R are stored), following the steps below:\n\nin the R console run file.edit(\"~/.Renviron\")\nin the file that opens add the line :\n\nJAVA_HOME = \"C:/Software/jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre\"\n\nsave the file and restart R\n\n\nFollow R packages installation procedure and run basic examples from the readme files of each package. They are all listed on this page"

    "text": "COSA project\nThe COSA (COfidentiality Seasonal Adjustment and time series) project is composed of two Centres of Excellence (CoE): one on Time Series Analysis (TSA), coordinated by Insee, and one on Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) coordinated by CBS. In a context of development of common tools and methods within the ESS, this action will carry on the work of the STACE project (2020-2024) around three pillars: knowledge sharing and support to practitioners, development and maintenance of bespoke software (JDemetra+ for TSA, τ-ARGUS and sdcMicro for SDC) and methodological guidance (Handbooks, Guidelines, research papers). The overarching goals is to provide user friendly, efficient and technically up-to date tools for statistical production in both fields.\nIn the previous project JDemetra+ has undergone a major refactoring with the development of version 3.x providing extensions of TSA algorithms, e.g. seasonal adjustment of high frequency data. The current action will aim at consolidating and completing this new version, by further extending some algorithms, improving technical and user-documentation, uploading R packages on CRAN and adapting JDemetra+ to new IT environments, like cloud infrastructure.\nΤ-ARGUS is considered to be the standard software for table protection. However, τ-ARGUS urgently needs to be modernized. The current project will make a start with developing/designing a modern software architecture for and apply some of the ideas in a proof of concept. The other SDC tools as well as the “old” τ-ARGUS needs to be supported.\nEleven institutions (Insee, CBS, NBB, Istat, INE, Destatis, SURS, HSO, Statistic Austria, Iceland and Norway) are beneficiaries from this grant and will contribute in the aforementioned directions with the collaboration of the Deutsche Bundesbank in TSA. Additional institutions will be involved as members of user-groups and observers (ECB, ABS, OECD…).\nResults will be presented at workshops and conferences and developments can be followed on dedicated Github repositories."
