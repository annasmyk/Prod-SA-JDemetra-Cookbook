The list of available extensions and the installation procedure are detailed [here](#t-plug-ins). How to access the added features in the GUI is described [here](#t-gui-sa).\n\nIn the **v2.x family** some of the additional features are:\n\n- Benchmarking and Temporal disaggregation [Plug-in here](https://github.com/nbbrd/jdemetra-benchmarking)\n    \n- Nowcasting [Plug-in here](https://github.com/nbbrd/jdemetra-nowcasting)\n    \nIn the **v3.x family** some of the additional features are:\n\n- Benchmarking and Temporal disaggregation [Plug-in here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-benchmarking)\n    \n- Seasonal adjustment of high frequency data [Plug-ins here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator)\n    \n- Additional algorithms for seasonal adjustment [Plug-ins here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator)\n\n\n### Cruncher \n\nJDemetra+ has an executable module, called the [Cruncher](#t-prod), allowing to automate tasks \n\nTo install it :\n\n- in v2, go to the [**JWSACruncher** page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher), **download** and **unzip** the compressed folder `jwsacruncher-2.2.x-bin.zip`, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.\n\n- in v3, go to the [**jdplus-main** page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main), **download** and **unzip** the compressed folder `jwsacruncher-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip`, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.\n\n### R packages \n\nJDemetra+ algorithms can be accessed in R, which is detailed [here](#t-r-packs)\n\nYou can directly head over to this [GitHub page](https://github.com/rjdverse?view_as=public), then for each package indications for installation and basic use are provided in the readme files.\n\n<!-- general readme to build and specific to check -->\n\n\n#### Configuration needed to run rjd3 packages {#Rconfig}\n\nTo use rjd3 packages in R, you need Java 17 or higher.\n\nYou can (and should) use the version of Java that comes with the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is contained in the file **jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip** available [on this page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/releases), in the \"Assets\" section, which you might have to expand to be able to see all the files.\n\nOnce unzipped, the Java will be in located in  [C:\\\\Software\\\\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\\\\nbdemetra\\\\jdk-21.0.2+13-jre]{.path} (path to be adapted to your computer/server): this location must be declared in R.\n\nAfter unzipping the file: \n\n- run this code at the beginning of your programs\n\n\n```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}\nSys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = \".../jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre\")\n```\n\nor \n\n- declare it \"permanently\" is the Renviron file (where environment variables specific to `R` are stored), following the steps below:\n\n    - in the R console run `file.edit(\"~/.Renviron\")`{.r}\n\n    - in the file that opens add the line :\n    ```\n    JAVA_HOME = \"C:/Software/jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre\"\n    ```\n\n    - save the file and restart R\n\nFollow R packages installation procedure and run basic examples from the readme files of each package.\nThey are all listed on [this page](https://github.com/rjdverse?view_as=public) \n    \n## COSA project {#COSA-abstract}\n\nThe COSA (**CO**fidentiality **S**easonal **A**djustment and time series) project is composed of two Centres of Excellence (CoE): one on Time Series Analysis (TSA), coordinated by Insee, and one on Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) coordinated by CBS. In a context of development of common tools and methods within the ESS, this action will carry on the work of the STACE project (2020-2024) around three pillars: knowledge sharing and support to practitioners, development and maintenance of bespoke software (JDemetra+ for TSA, τ-ARGUS and sdcMicro for SDC) and methodological guidance (Handbooks, Guidelines, research papers). The overarching goals is to provide user friendly, efficient and technically up-to date tools for statistical production in both fields. \n\nIn the previous project JDemetra+ has undergone a major refactoring with the development of version 3.x providing extensions of TSA algorithms, e.g. seasonal adjustment of high frequency data. The current action will aim at consolidating and completing this new version, by further extending some algorithms, improving technical and user-documentation, uploading R packages on CRAN and adapting JDemetra+ to new IT environments, like cloud infrastructure. \n\nΤ-ARGUS is considered to be the standard software for table protection. However, τ-ARGUS urgently needs to be modernized. The current project will make a start with developing/designing a modern software architecture for and apply some of the ideas in a proof of concept. The other SDC tools as well as the “old” τ-ARGUS needs to be supported.\n\nEleven institutions (Insee, CBS, NBB, Istat, INE, Destatis, SURS, HSO, Statistic Austria, Iceland and Norway) are beneficiaries from this grant and will contribute in the aforementioned directions with the collaboration of the Deutsche Bundesbank in TSA. Additional \ninstitutions will be involved as members of user-groups and observers (ECB, ABS, OECD...).\n\nResults will be presented at workshops and conferences and developments can be followed on dedicated Github repositories.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
